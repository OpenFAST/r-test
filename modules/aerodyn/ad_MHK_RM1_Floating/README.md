## ad_MHK_RM1_Floating

Test of features for floating MHK turbines, including cavitation and buoyancy

- Floating MHK RM1 turbine (MHK = 2)
- Steady inflow
- Standard geometry inputs for aerodyn driver
- Base motion taken from platform motion of fully coupled OpenFAST model
- No yaw or blade pitch
- Fixed rotor rotational speed
- DBEMT
- Steady airfoil aerodynamics
- Cavitation turned on

MHK RM1 turbine based on the following reference:
