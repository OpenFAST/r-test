"-M8N2MKxe"                             - Action moments [Nm] for the row 8 (M8) second node defined (N2) in the MEMBER OUTPUT LIST above. Results expressed in local member coordinate system.
"M9N1FKze"                              - Static component of action force. Note that Z is the axial direction in the local member coordinate system.
