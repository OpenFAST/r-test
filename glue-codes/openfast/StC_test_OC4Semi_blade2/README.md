## StC\_test\_OC4Semi\_blade2

This test case illustrates Stuctural Controls on the blade with only loads applied on blaed 2. This is not a realisitic scenario and is only meant as illustrative.

### Model description

OC4 semi-submersible with rigid structure, no contoller, yaw fixed, fixed rotation rate.

### StC locations

- StC at blades
     Point force along blade local `y` direction (edgewise).  Ramps from 0-4 seconds, steady to 40 seconds, drops to zero.  Loads are unrealisically large.
     Load is only applied on blade 2, with no loads on other blades
