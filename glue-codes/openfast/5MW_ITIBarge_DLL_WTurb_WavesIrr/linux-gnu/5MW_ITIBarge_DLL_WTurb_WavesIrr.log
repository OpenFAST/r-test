     for use in offshore analysis

 Running ElastoDyn.
 Nodal outputs section of ElastoDyn input file not found or improperly formatted.
 Running AeroDyn14.
 Running InflowWind.

    Reading a 31x31 grid (145 m wide, 17.5 m to 162.5 m above ground) with a characteristic wind
    speed of 12 m/s. This full-field file was generated by TurbSim (v1.06.00, 21-Sep-2012) on
    07-Jan-2014 at 12:50:45.

    Processed 1442 time steps of 20-Hz full-field data (72.05 seconds).
 Running ServoDyn.
