This test was originally developed by @erickaloz for a paper with @Lucas-Carmo

This test is based on the IEA15 MW turbine on the VolturnUS platform.  This test is to verify that shared mooring lines with MoorDyn runs.

The environmental settings in this test do not reflect a real world scenario, so do not use them as such.  Assumptions:
 - steady wind
 - no waves
 - no controller
 - rigid blades and tower
 - initial platform offets found after running 300 second simulation
